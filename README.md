# phosRg
phosRg is a phosphorylated protein force field parameter which can best fit to the radius of gyration.
# Usage
phosRg modify the oxygen atomic radius to 1.7400â„« in file frcmod.phosaa10,the phosphorus atomic charge to 1.4600(a.u) in file phos_amino94.lib based on the dual objectives of radius of gyration and solvation free energy.When using the modified stance parameters for simulation, you need to import the updated file into the current folder for correction.Other parameter files required for ff99SBildn simulations are also presented here and can be downloaded together.
